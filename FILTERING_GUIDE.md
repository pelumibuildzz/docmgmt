# Document Management Filtering System

## Overview
The document management system now includes comprehensive filtering functionality that works with both URL query parameters (from sidenav navigation) and dropdown filters.

## Features Implemented

### 1. URL Query Parameter Filtering (Sidenav)
- **Keep in View**: `/dashboard/doc-mgmt?filter=keep-in-view`
- **Assigned To Me**: `/dashboard/doc-mgmt?filter=assigned-to-me`
- **Ongoing Review**: `/dashboard/doc-mgmt?filter=ongoing-review`
- **Due Today**: `/dashboard/doc-mgmt?filter=due-today`
- **Updated Docs**: `/dashboard/doc-mgmt?filter=updated-docs`
- **Completed Docs**: `/dashboard/doc-mgmt?filter=completed-docs`
- **Archived Docs**: `/dashboard/doc-mgmt?filter=archived-docs`

### 2. Dropdown Filters
- **Priority**: High, Medium, Low
- **Status**: In Progress, Completed, Archived, Pending, Under Review
- **Due Date Range**: From/To date selection
- **Date Received Range**: From/To date selection

### 3. Active Filters Display
- Shows all currently applied filters as removable chips
- Individual filter removal
- "Clear all" functionality

### 4. Document Display
- **Table View**: Shows all document details in tabular format
- **Grid View**: Shows documents in card layout
- Dynamic document count display
- "No documents found" message when filters return empty results

## Testing the Functionality

### Basic Testing Steps:
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/doc-mgmt`
2. Click on "Document Management" in the sidenav to expand sub-options
3. Try different sidenav filters (e.g., "Due Today", "Assigned To Me")
4. Use the "Filter By" dropdown to apply additional filters
5. Combine multiple filters and observe the results
6. Remove individual filters using the X button on filter chips
7. Clear all filters at once
8. Switch between table and grid views

### Mock Data Included:
- 8 sample documents with various combinations of:
  - Different priorities (high, medium, low)
  - Different statuses (in-progress, completed, archived, pending, under-review)
  - Some due today, some assigned to current user
  - Some updated recently, some with keep-in-view flag

### Expected Behavior:
- URL changes reflect selected filters
- Filter chips show active filters
- Document count updates based on filters
- Sidenav highlights active filter option
- Both table and grid views respect filters
- Filters can be combined (e.g., "Due Today" + "High Priority")

## Code Structure

### Key Files:
- `src/types/document.ts` - Type definitions
- `src/data/mockDocuments.ts` - Sample data
- `src/utils/documentFilters.ts` - Filtering logic
- `src/components/active-filters.tsx` - Filter display component
- `src/app/dashboard/doc-mgmt/page.tsx` - Main page with state management

### Integration Points:
